# NYC Public Assistance Analysis

This is a case study I created to gain insights into the distribution of individuals and households receiving government assistance programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Cash Assistance (CA), and Medicaid Benefits (MA) across different boroughs and community districts in New York City.

You can find the entire analysis in the data-analysis.ipynb file.
